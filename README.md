   <h1>Operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API</h1>

      <h2>Project Overview</h2>

In this project, we have been asked to apply the skills that we have acquired in this course to operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API.

We have been given a pre-trained, sklearn model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. More information about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, is available on the data source site. This project tests the students ability to operationalize a Python flask app—in a provided file, app.py—that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls. This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, such as those for image recognition and data labeling.

<h2>Project Tasks</h2>

The project goal is to operationalize this working, machine learning microservice using kubernetes, which is an open-source system for automating the management of containerized applications. In this project i have completed the below tasks;


<h3>Task 1: Complete the Dockerfile</h3>


<h3>Task 2: Run a Container & Make a Prediction</h3> 


<h3>Task 3: Improve Logging & Save Output</h3> 


<h3>Task 4: Upload the Docker Image</h3> 



<h3>Task 5: Configure Kubernetes to Run Locally</h3> 


<h3>Task 6: Deploy with Kubernetes and Save Output Logs</h3> 


<h3>Task 7: [Important] Delete Cluster</h3> 


<h3>Task 8: CircleCI Integration</h3> 


<h3>Task 9: README.md</h3>
